                I am a student from Dian Nuswantoro University Semarang and a
                graduate of SMK majoring in Software Engineering. My experience
                in creating websites while at Vocational School has enriched my
                technical skills. As a student, I was involved in academic
                projects that involved in-depth analysis and participated in an
                academic environment that supported the development of
                interpersonal skills. I have a passion to continue learning and
                developing, following the latest developments in the IT
                industry. With my formal education and practical background, I
                am confident that I am ready to become a web developer and
                contribute to the information technology industry.
